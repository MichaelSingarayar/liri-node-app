LIRI uses API calls from command line input to give you information about: movies, concerts, and music. It does this using OMBD, Spotify, and Bands in Town APIs.

# Spotify
From the command line using node the user will search Spotify using "spotify-this-song" along with an artist and return:

- Artist(s)
- The song's name
- The album that the song is from
- A preview link of the song from Spotify
- If no artist search is provided LIRI will return searches for "The Sign".
